        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round,</p> <p>prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked</p> on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. 
        It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric societies.
